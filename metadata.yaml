description: Is there something about aesthetic beauty that can soothe the soul of
  even the most troubled individual? That's the question at the center of Booth Tarkington's
  eminently entertaining short novel The Beautiful Lady. In the story, a down-on-his-luck
  Italian who is barely scraping by in Paris has his whole life turned upside down
  by a chance encounter with the enchanting temptress referred to in the book's title.
